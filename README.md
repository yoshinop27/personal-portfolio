This is a modern, responsive portfolio website built with HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript that showcases development projects, graphic design work, and community involvement. The site features a mobile-first design with CSS Grid layouts, dynamic header/footer components loaded via fetch API, and interactive card-based sections. Key technical highlights include a hamburger navigation menu for mobile devices, hover animations on project cards, and a consolidated CSS architecture using utility classes for maintainability. The responsive design adapts from multi-column grid layouts on desktop to single-column stacked layouts on mobile, with consistent 1rem margins and optimized typography using Georgia for headings and Open Sans for body text. Built without frameworks for optimal performance, the site demonstrates modern web development best practices including semantic HTML, accessibility considerations, and DRY principles through modular component architecture.
