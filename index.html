                Hi! My name is Preston Yoshino. I'm a third-year student at Grinnell College
                double majoring in computer science and mathematics with a minor in statistics.
                Aside from my formal studies, I am passionate about learning graphic design and UI/UX
                design. In addition to being a student, I am a member of the Grinnell College baseball
                team - I am a middle infielder, and also serve as a designated team leader, social media
                manager, and graphic design/content creation lead.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                After I finish my studies, I hope to pursue a career in software engineering,
                machine learning, or quantitative finance.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                During my free time I enjoy going to the beach, playing basketball, and working 
                as a server at one of the local resturaunts in my hometown.

            <p>
                8.12.2025 - I am currently finishing up my internship at Servco Pacific inc. I worked
                with the distribution department, to create end-to-end solutions that helped analyze 
                parts data, automate manual workflows, and optimize internal user application experiences.
