                    Hi! My name is Preston Yoshino. I'm a third-year student at Grinnell College
                    double majoring in computer science and mathematics with a minor in statistics.
                    Aside from my formal studies, I am passionate about learning graphic design and UI/UX
                    design. In addition to being a student, I am a member of the Grinnell College baseball
                    team where I am a middle infielder. 
                </p>

                    After I finish my studies, I hope to pursue a career in software engineering,
                    machine learning, or quantitative finance.

                    During my free time I enjoy going to the beach, playing basketball, and working 
                    as a server at one of the local resturaunts in my hometown.
