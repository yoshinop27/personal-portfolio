      <p>
        Hi! My name is Preston Yoshino. I'm a third-year student at Grinnell College
        double majoring in computer science and mathematics with a minor in statistics.
        Aside from my formal studies, I am passionate about learning graphic design and UI/UX
        design. In addition to being a student, I am a member of the Grinnell College baseball
        team where I am a middle infielder.

        After I finish my studies, I hope to pursue a career in software engineering,
        machine learning, or quantitative finance.

        as a server at one of the local restaurants in my hometown.

        8.12.2025 - I am currently finishing up my internship at Servco Pacific inc. I worked
        with the distribution department, to create end-to-end solutions that helped analyze 
        parts data, automate manual workflows, and optimize internal user application experiences.
