      <p>
        <b>Aloha!</b> My name is Preston Yoshino and I'm from Aiea, Hawaii.
        I'm currently a third-year student at Grinnell College
        double majoring in computer science and mathematics with a minor in statistics.
        Aside from my formal studies, I am passionate about graphic design, UI/UX design
        and content creation. I am also a middle infielder for Grinnell College baseball
        team.

        After I finish my studies, I hope to pursue a career in software engineering,
        machine learning, or quantitative finance.

        as a server at a diner in my hometown.
