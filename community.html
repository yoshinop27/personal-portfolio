                Outside of my responsibilites as a Student-Athlete I try to find 
                ways to foster community in the 
                places that I'm at and also give back to the communites that I am a part of.

                <p>
                    Dream Team Hawaii is a federaly recognized non profit on a mission 
                    to democratize financial literacy and entrepreneurial skills. Since
                    taking over the orginization, I have started an intiative that will bring 
                    our curriculum into the 21st century by organizing a team to design an 
                    interactive app to teach our lessons.

                <p>
                    As a part of my internship, I volunteered with team Serve to 
                    give back to the Hawaii community. Two of the projects we did were
                    harvesting luau leaves to donate to various food banks and organizing backpacks
                    with school supplies for elementary students.

                <p>
                    In my role as a server, I have seen firsthand how food has the power to 
                    bring people together. Each shift gives me the privilege of helping families 
                    celebrate milestones, enriching reunions, welcoming visitors to Hawaii, 
                    and connecting with members of my community. I cherish the moments when 
                    a shared meal creates laughter, conversation, and lasting memories, and 
                    I find deep joy in being part of those experiences.

                <p>
                    A-Town Elite was a local basketball team I started
                    that competed in various leagues, 
                    capping off our summer season by participating
                    in an international basketball tournament where we finished 3rd! This was a great
                    way for our guys to build lifelong friendships, stay active, and learn valueable
                    teamwork skills. All opportunites were provided at either low or no cost depending
                    on the situation.
