                    In college I recently discovered my passion for art, specifically graphic
                    design. On the Grinnell College baseball team I serve as a social media manager
                    and graphic design lead, where I am resposible for creating 
                    weekly content to upload to our social media accounts. Over the past couple of month
                    I have started to learn and practice using Adobe Photoshop and Canva
                    to create graphic while also leveraging various AI tools.
